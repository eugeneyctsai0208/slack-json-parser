# slack-json-parser
Just something I made because I was bored LOL

A friend asked if I am able to help create something to help visualize the downloaded json files of their slack channel in a more user-friendly manner. I was thinking of using Python at first but then I realized then I'll have to teach my friend to use the terminal unless I want to have some sort of webserver running but I don't want to pay, so I wrote it in javascript so Github can host it (THANKS GITHUB!!!)
